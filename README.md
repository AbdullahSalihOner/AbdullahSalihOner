# 👋 Hello, I'm Salih!

Since 2019, I've been actively engaged in software development. My journey began with two years of study in mechanical engineering, which honed my analytical thinking and facilitated a smooth transition to computer engineering. This foundation has been invaluable in designing efficient systems and solving complex problems.

I've developed projects across various programming languages and technologies, gaining experience in game development, web and mobile applications, embedded systems, data science, and machine learning. Through formal education and hands-on projects, I've had the opportunity to delve into and understand these diverse domains.

As an engineer, I am always ready to tackle challenges, continually embracing learning and growth. 

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Java & Spring Framework (Boot, Data, Cloud, Security, Rest)**, **Microservices Architecture**, and **DevOps practices** with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **CI/CD**.

- ❓ Ask me about anything related to **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Microservices**, or **DevOps** technologies.

- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in **DevOps** by exploring tools like **Ansible**, **Terraform**, and **Jenkins**, and diving deeper into **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a background in **Mechanical Engineering**, which gives me a unique approach to problem-solving in software!

- 📚 I’m always eager to learn and currently advancing my knowledge in **prompt engineering** and **cloud-based deployments**.
