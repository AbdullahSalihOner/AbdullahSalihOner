# 👋 Hello, I'm Salih!

Since late 2019, I have been deeply engaged in software development, working on a variety of projects that have fueled my passion for technology. My journey began with two years of study in mechanical engineering, which honed my analytical thinking and provided a unique perspective when I transitioned to computer engineering. This foundation has been invaluable in designing efficient systems and solving complex problems.

As an engineer, I am always ready to tackle challenges, continually embracing learning and growth. With each project, I strive to build reliable, scalable solutions that make a meaningful impact.I’m a fast learner with a passion for continuous improvement, finding fulfillment in tackling new challenges without losing momentum. I am also highly skilled in prompt engineering, effectively bridging technology with strategic thinking to create meaningful solutions.

I have developed projects in multiple languages and technologies, gaining experience across various fields in software development. My journey has led me to explore areas like game development, web, mobile, embedded systems, data science, and machine learning. Through a combination of formal training and hands-on projects, I have had the opportunity to dive into and understand these diverse domains.

I am particularly skilled in backend development, where I use Java and Spring Boot to design layered and microservice architectures.

Recently, I've been focusing on DevOps to deepen my expertise in creating seamless, efficient deployment pipelines.
