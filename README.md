# 👋 Hello, I'm Salih!

Since late 2019, I have been deeply engaged in software development, working on a variety of projects that have fueled my passion for technology. My journey began with two years of study in mechanical engineering, which honed my analytical thinking and provided a unique perspective when I transitioned to computer engineering. This foundation has been invaluable in designing efficient systems and solving complex problems.

I have developed projects in multiple languages and technologies, gaining experience across various fields in software development. My journey has led me to explore areas like game development, web, mobile, embedded systems, data science, and machine learning. Through a combination of formal training and hands-on projects, I have had the opportunity to dive into and understand these diverse domains.

As an engineer, I am always ready to tackle challenges, continually embracing learning and growth. 

## 🚀 About Me
